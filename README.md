# Machine Learning Resources

This is a comprehensive list of machine learning and deep learning resources. Resources cover the theory and implementation of LLM and image diffusion models. If you'd like to contribute a resource then please open a new [issue](https://github.com/dgwyer/ml-resources/issues/new) or submit a [PR](https://github.com/dgwyer/ml-resources/pulls).

## Work In Progress

This is a very new list of ML resources so the structure may change around while we figure out the best way to organize the resources. By all means [let me know](https://github.com/dgwyer/ml-resources/issues/new) what you think and how it can be improved! As you may have noticed most (or almost all!) resources focus on diffusion models. This is because where most of my focus has been these last few months. But I do want to transition to cover LLMs too. So if you have some good language based resources you'd like to share please [let me know](https://github.com/dgwyer/ml-resources/issues/new).
